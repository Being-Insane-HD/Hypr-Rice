ARCH HYPRLAND SWWW THEME SWITCHER

THEME SWITCHER BASED ON KEYBINDS AND SHELL SCRIPT

=> MAKE SURE TO ADD KEYBINDS LIKE THIS IN HYPRLAND KEYBIND CONFIG(BY DEFAULT .config/hypr/hyprland.conf)
    `bind = < YOUR OWN KEYBIND >, exec, ~/.config/swww/switch-theme.sh 
     bind = < YOUR OWN KEYBIND >, exec, ~/.config/swww/theme-next.sh && ~/.config/swww/switch-theme.sh`

=> TO ADD A NEW WALLPAPER, JUST ADD WALLPAPER IN WHICHEVER WALLPAPER DIRECTORY YOU WANT TO PUT. TO CHECK THE WALLPAPER DIRECTORY CHECK EITHER OF THE swww-wall SCRIPTS IN THE SUBFOLDERS theme1 OR theme2.

=> TO ADD A NEW THEME, FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. CREATE A SEPARATE FOLDER IN THE WALLPAPER DIRECTORY ALONGSIDE THE OTHER WALLPAPER FOLDERS TO GROUP IN THE WALLPAPERS YOU WANT  SPECIFICALLY FOR THE NEW THEME
    (SAY, IF THE NEW THEME IS THEME 3, MAKE A FOLDER CALLED theme3 INSIDE THE WALLPAPER DIRECTORY)

2. COPY PASTE ONE OF THE SUBFOLDERS theme1 OR theme2 AND RENAME IT TO theme3 AND INSIDE THE FOLDER RENAME THE SCRIPT TO swww-wall3.sh

3. CHANGE THIS PART OF THE SYNTAX IN theme-next.sh:

        `if [ "$LAST_THEME" == "theme1" ]; then
            echo "theme2" > "$STATE_FILE"
        else
            echo "theme1" > "$STATE_FILE"
        fi`

    TO THIS SYNTAX:

        `if [ "$LAST_THEME" == "theme1" ]; then
            echo "theme2" > "$STATE_FILE"
        elif [ "$LAST_THEME" == "theme2" ]; then
            echo "theme3" > "$STATE_FILE"
        else
            echo "theme1" > "$STATE_FILE"
        fi`

    THIS WILL ROTATE BETWEEN THEMES IN A NEXT-THEME ORDER. FOR ANY MORE SUBSEQUENT THEMES ADDED, JUST KEEP COPY-PASTING elif BLOCK BEFORE else BLOCK AND CHANGING THE LAST THEME AND ECHO STATEMENT ACCORDINGLY. NOW SAVE THE FILE

4. OPEN switch-theme SCRIPT AND ADD THE DIRECTORY OF THE NEW THEME SCRIPT AS:

        `THEME3_SCRIPT="$HOME/.config/swww/theme3/swww-wall3.sh"`

    SAME FOR SUBSEQUENT THEMES

5. CHANGE THE SYNTAX OF THIS PART:

        `if [ "$LAST_THEME" == "theme1" ]; then
            exec "$THEME1_SCRIPT"
        else
            exec "$THEME2_SCRIPT"
        fi`

    TO THIS PART:

        `if [ "$LAST_THEME" == "theme1" ]; then
            exec "$THEME1_SCRIPT"
        elif [ "$LAST_THEME" == "theme2" ]; then
            exec "$THEME2_SCRIPT"
        else
            exec "$THEME3_SCRIPT"
        fi`

    FOR ANY MORE SUBSEQUENT THEMES ADDED, JUST KEEP COPY-PASTING elif BLOCK BEFORE else BLOCK AND CHANGING THE LAST THEME AND EXEC STATEMENT ACCORDINGLY.NOW SAVE THE FILE.

6. OPEN THE NEWLY CREATED/RENAMED swww-wall3.sh SCRIPT AND REPLACE THE FOLLOWING ACCORDINGLY:
    CHANGE:
        `WALLPAPER_DIR1="$HOME/< PATH TO WALLPAPER FOLDER >/theme1"`
    TO:
        `WALLPAPER_DIR3="$HOME/< PATH TO WALLPAPER FOLDER >/theme3"`

    CHANGE:
        `WALLPAPERS=($(find "$WALLPAPER_DIR1" -type f | sort))`
    TO:
        `WALLPAPERS=($(find "$WALLPAPER_DIR3" -type f | sort))`

    CHANGE:
        `echo "No wallpapers found in $WALLPAPER_DIR1"`
    TO:
        `echo "No wallpapers found in $WALLPAPER_DIR3"`
    FOR ANY MORE SUBSEQUENT THEMES ADDED, KEEP CHANGING THE NUMBERS BASED ON THEME NUMBERS. NOW SAVE THE FILE.
